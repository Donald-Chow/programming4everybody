# two astronauts who are racing to the moon
# the first astronaut to the moon, wins!

# it takes ten "spaces" to get to the moon
# each player takes a turn rolling a dice

# Pseudo Code
# 0. puts a welcome message to the game
# 1. ask user for their name
# 2. get the user's name
# 3. (optional) give the computer a name
# 4a. create the user_position = 0
# 4b. create the computer_position = 0

## Star the loop HERE

# 5. Display who is up -> User
# 6. roll the dice 1 - 6
# 7. increment the user_position by the dice number
# 8. Display the new position

# 5. Display who is up -> computer
# 6. roll the dice 1 - 6
# 7. increment the computer_position by the dice number
# 8. Display the new position

## End the loop HERE

# 9. Loop -> while / until

# 10. Compare the user_position with the computer_position
