# Syntax Sugar
# syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express.
# It makes the language "sweeter" for human use

# if / unless -> conditional statements (they are oppsites)

# if or unless -> which one makes more sense?
# unless names.include?('sylvain')

# if condition in one line
if names.include?('sylvain')
  'He is in the team!'
end

# rewrite into one line. more the if to the end of the line -> one condition
'He is in the team!' if names.include?('sylvain')

# writing a conditional statement in one line, with two conditions
# ternary operator
# condition ? 'truthy side' : 'falsy side'

# DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
