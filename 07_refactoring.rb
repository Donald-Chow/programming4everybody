# Syntax Sugar
# syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use

# If Conditions

names = ['doug', 'sasha', 'sylvain', 'yann', 'trouni']

if names.include?('sylvain')
  "He is in the team!"
else
  "He isn't in the team!"
end

# if and unless are just opposites

# shorter way (one line) at the end of your line
# do something if condition
'He is in the team!' if names.include?('sylvain') # there is no end for a one-liner
# puts "He isn't in the team!" unless names.include?('sylvain')

# ternary operator (2 possible scenarios)
# condition ? what happens when truthy : what happens when falsey
names.include?('sylvain') ? 'He is in the team!' : 'He is not in the team!'

# only checking for equality

# ask the user where they are from
# store the user's country
# i will greet the in their language

# DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
